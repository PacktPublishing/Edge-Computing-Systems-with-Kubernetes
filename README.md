This is the code repository for [Edge Computing Systems with Kubernetes](https://www.packtpub.com/product/edge-computing-systems-with-kubernetes/9781800568594), published by Packt.

**A use guide for building edge systems using K3s, k3OS, and open source cloud native technologies**

[Errata](errata/README.md) in the this repository too. **(In progress)**

## What is this book about?
Edge computing is a way of processing information near the source of data instead of processing it on data centers in the cloud. In this way, edge computing can reduce latency when data is processed, improving the user experience on real-time data visualization for your applications. Using K3s, a light-weight Kubernetes and k3OS, a K3s-based Linux distribution along with other open source cloud native technologies, you can build reliable edge computing systems without spending a lot of money.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Configure k3OS and K3s for development and production scenarios
* Package applications into K3s for shipped-node scenarios
* Deploy in occasionally connected scenarios, from one node to one million nodes
* Manage GitOps for applications across different locations
* Use open source cloud native software to complement your edge computing systems
* Implement observability event-driven and serverless edge applications
* Collect and process data from sensors at the edge and visualize it into the cloud

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter12.

The code will look like the following:
```
@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
 return 'It works'
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for engineers (developers and/or operators) seeking to bring the cloud native benefits of GitOps and Kubernetes to the edge. Anyone with basic knowledge of Linux and containers looking to learn Kubernetes using examples applied to edge computing and hardware systems will benefit from this book.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-15).
### Software and Hardware List
| Chapter | Software required | OS required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 1-15 | Raspberry Pi | Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (Any) |
